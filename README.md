## Repo Contents

- [**app**](https://github.com/OnyekaN/Z-Brain-2/tree/master/app)
contains all of the sources for the AngularJS frontend. **assets** for static files served to the frontend, and **common** for the controllers used by the frontend.

- [**bin**](https://github.com/OnyekaN/Z-Brain-2/tree/master/bin) contains a binary file used to launch the Express application server.  The commands used to launch are `npm start`, `npm run devel`, or `npm run prod`, respectively, for a basic node server, a **nodemon** development server, or a basic node server with `env` set to production

- [**db**](https://github.com/OnyekaN/Z-Brain-2/tree/master/db) contains the **Jupyter notebooks** used to create all the mask and label images, and to create entries for them in the Z-Brain's **PostgreSQL** database 

- [**node_modules**](https://github.com/OnyekaN/Z-Brain-2/tree/master/node_modules) contains all of the **npm** dependencies for the application

- [**routes**](https://github.com/OnyekaN/Z-Brain-2/tree/master/routes) contains the routes and controllers used by the Express backend

- **_misc. files_**
    - **image_modify.py**- script to adjust label white white-levels
    - **package-lock.json**- automatically generated by npm

- [**(Randlett et al., 2015)**](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v12/n11/abs/nmeth.3581.html) *Paper Abstract* - In order to localize the neural circuits involved in generating behaviors, it is necessary to assign activity onto anatomical maps of the nervous system. Using brain registration across hundreds of larval zebrafish, we have built an expandable open-source atlas containing molecular labels and definitions of anatomical regions, the Z-Brain [...].
