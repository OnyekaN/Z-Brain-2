## Contents

- [**app**](https://github.com/OnyekaN/Z-Brain-2/tree/master/app)
contains all of the sources for the AngularJS frontend. **assets** for static files served to the frontend, and **common** for the controllers used by the frontend.

- [**bin**](https://github.com/OnyekaN/Z-Brain-2/tree/master/bin) contains a binary file used to launch the Express application server.  The commands used to launch are `npm start`, `npm run devel`, or `npm run prod`, respectively, for a basic node server, a **nodemon** development server, or a basic node server with `env` set to production

- [**db**](https://github.com/OnyekaN/Z-Brain-2/tree/master/db) contains the **Jupyter notebooks** used to create all the mask and label images, and to create entries for them in the Z-Brain's **PostgreSQL** database 

- [**node_modules**](https://github.com/OnyekaN/Z-Brain-2/tree/master/node_modules) contains all of the **npm** dependencies for the application

- [**routes**](https://github.com/OnyekaN/Z-Brain-2/tree/master/routes) contains the routes and controllers used by the Express backend

Using brain registration across hundreds of larval zebrafish, we have built an expandable open-source atlas containing molecular labels and definitions of anatomical regions, the Z-Brain [...].
